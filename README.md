## ‚ú® Project Vision & Philosophy

### Core Goals

"The Scent" aims to be more than just another e-commerce site. It's envisioned as a digital sanctuary where users can mindfully explore and purchase high-quality aromatherapy products. It marries **mindful UX**, **robust engineering**, and potentially **sustainable business practices** in its ethos. The primary goals for v1.0 are:

1.  **Flawless & Mindful User Experience:** A beautiful, intuitive, responsive, and accessible interface that guides users effortlessly from discovery to checkout. Mobile-first design is paramount. The experience should feel calm and considered.
2.  **Robust & Reliable Backend:** A stable, secure, and well-tested platform capable of handling typical e-commerce workloads, built on proven technologies and best practices.
3.  **Developer Ergonomics & Maintainability:** A clean, readable, well-documented, and easily testable codebase that is a pleasure for developers to understand, extend, and contribute to. Leverage the power and elegance of the Laravel ecosystem effectively.
4.  **Future-Proof Architecture:** A modular design, influenced by DDD principles, that facilitates future expansion, such as integrating new features (subscriptions, gift cards, AI quizzes), scaling components independently, or potentially adopting a headless architecture for native mobile apps or distinct frontends.

### Guiding Principles

*   **Simplicity & Elegance:** Strive for clarity in code and design. Favor simple solutions over complex ones. Leverage framework conventions but don't be afraid to deviate thoughtfully where it provides significant benefits. *Thin Controllers, Fat Services/Actions, Lean Models*.
*   **Security by Default:** Integrate security considerations from the outset, not as an afterthought. Follow OWASP guidelines and employ framework features diligently.
*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD) Mindset:** While not strictly enforced for every line, aim to write tests alongside or before application code to ensure correctness, facilitate refactoring, and prevent regressions. Strive for high, meaningful test coverage (Unit, Feature, E2E).
*   **Modularity & Decoupling:** Design components with clear responsibilities (Single Responsibility Principle) and minimal dependencies. Utilize Laravel's Service Container, Domain Events, and potentially Action classes to achieve loose coupling. Structure code within domain contexts where appropriate (see [Directory Layout](#key-customizations-appdomain)).
*   **Performance Awareness:** Build with performance in mind from the start. Utilize caching (application, database query, HTTP), optimize database queries (N+1 prevention, appropriate indexing), implement efficient background processing, and employ modern frontend techniques (asset bundling, lazy loading).
*   **Accessibility First (a11y):** Ensure the application is usable by everyone, regardless of ability, by adhering to WCAG 2.1 AA standards as closely as possible. Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

## üöÄ Key Features Deep Dive

This section elaborates on the highlights, providing more context on implementation details.

### UI/UX Highlights

*   **Responsive Design:** Fully adaptive layout using Tailwind CSS's responsive utilities (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:`). Tested across various screen sizes.
*   **Light/Dark Mode:** User-selectable theme preference stored in `localStorage`. Implemented using Tailwind's `dark:` variant, CSS variables defined in `resources/css/app.css`, and a simple Alpine.js component to toggle a class on the `<html>` element.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Subtle animations and transitions managed via CSS and potentially Alpine.js (`x-transition`). Focus on smooth, non-jarring interactions. SPA-like navigation might be achieved using Laravel's built-in support or future integration with tools like Hotwire/Turbo or Inertia.js.
*   **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA Target):** Semantic HTML (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`), ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-live`, roles) used where native semantics are insufficient, sufficient color contrast enforced via Tailwind theme configuration (`tailwind.config.js`), clear keyboard navigation paths, visible focus indicators (`focus:ring`).
*   **Parallax Scrolling:** Implemented selectively on the landing page hero section using CSS background properties or potentially a minimal JS library for subtle depth effect.
*   **Ambient Sound Toggle (Optional):** If implemented, likely involves a simple HTML5 `<audio>` element controlled by an Alpine.js component, allowing the user to play/pause a calming background track. Stored preference in `localStorage`.

### E-commerce Engine

*   **Product Catalog:** `products` table stores core info (name, slug, description, price). `categories` and `tags` provide organization (many-to-many relationships). `product_variants` table handles variations (e.g., size: 10ml, 30ml; scent: Lavender, Eucalyptus) linked to a base product, potentially storing overrides for price or SKU, and having their own inventory tracking. Supports `is_digital` flag for non-shippable items. Images managed via `spatie/laravel-medialibrary` or similar, allowing multiple images per product/variant.
*   **Inventory Management:** `inventory_levels` table (or similar) tracks stock quantity per `product_variant_id` (or `product_id` if no variants) potentially linked to a `warehouse_id` for future multi-location support. Stock deduction occurs upon confirmed order or payment, potentially using atomic database operations or optimistic locking to prevent overselling during checkout race conditions.
*   **Shopping Cart:** Utilizes `laravel/session` for guest carts and a dedicated `carts` database table for logged-in users (associating `user_id` with cart data). Cart items stored as serialized data or in a related `cart_items` table. Cart updates on the frontend likely handled by Alpine.js making AJAX requests to dedicated CartController endpoints, or potentially using Livewire for more reactive updates.
*   **Flexible Checkout:** Guest checkout stores shipping/billing addresses temporarily (e.g., in session or passed directly to order). Registered users can select from saved addresses (`addresses` table linked to `users`). The process involves steps like address entry, shipping method selection, payment, and confirmation. State managed via session or frontend state.
*   **Discount Engine:** `discounts` table stores coupon codes, types (percentage, fixed amount), values, usage limits (per coupon, per user), date ranges (start/end dates), minimum purchase amounts, and potentially applicability rules (specific products/categories). Applied via a `DiscountService` during cart/checkout calculation.
*   **Tax Calculation:** Configurable via a `TaxRate` model/table, potentially associated with `ShippingZone` or based on product type (`tax_categories` table). A `TaxService` calculates taxes based on the shipping address and cart contents during checkout. Could use a package like `laravel/cashier`'s tax features or a dedicated tax calculation service API for complex scenarios.
*   **Shipping Zones & Rates:** `shipping_zones` define geographical regions (countries, states/provinces, postcodes). `shipping_methods` (e.g., Standard, Express) are linked to zones with associated costs (flat rate, weight-based, price-based) stored in `shipping_rates`. Calculated during checkout based on the shipping address.
*   **Payment Integration:** Uses adapters/services for specific gateways. `Stripe` integration via `stripe/stripe-php` or `laravel/cashier` for Card payments (using Payment Intents), SEPA, iDEAL etc. `PayPal` integration via official PayPal SDKs. Securely handles API keys via `.env`. Webhooks (`/webhooks/stripe`, `/webhooks/paypal`) are crucial for confirming asynchronous payment success/failure, secured via signature verification.

### Authentication & Authorization

*   **Standard Authentication:** Built using Laravel's starter kits (Breeze/Jetstream) or Fortify, providing robust email/password login, registration, password reset flows. Passwords hashed using `bcrypt`.
*   **Social Login:** Implemented using `laravel/socialite`, configured for providers like Google, Facebook, GitHub via `.env` keys and callbacks defined in `config/services.php`. Links social accounts to existing users or creates new users.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Optional layer via TOTP (Google Authenticator compatible). Can be implemented using `laravel/fortify`'s built-in features or packages like `pragmarx/google2fa-laravel`. Future consideration for WebAuthn/Passkeys using packages like `laravie/authen`.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Simple implementation using a `role` column (e.g., enum or string: `admin`, `staff`, `customer`) on the `users` table. Access control enforced using Laravel Gates (`Gate::define`) and Policies (`ProductPolicy`, `OrderPolicy`) defined in `app/Policies` and registered in `AuthServiceProvider`. Admin routes are protected by middleware checking for the 'admin' role.

### Admin Dashboard

*   **Overview KPIs:** Displays key metrics like Total Sales (last 24h/7d/30d), Average Order Value, New Customers, Pending Orders. Data potentially calculated via scheduled commands (`php artisan schedule:run`) populating a cache or summary table, or updated via event listeners (`OrderPlaced`, `UserRegistered`) for near real-time updates. Uses Chart.js or similar via Alpine.js for visualizations.
*   **Order Management:** Dedicated section (`/admin/orders`) listing orders with filtering (by status, date, customer) and search. Ability to view order details (items, customer info, shipping, payment status) and update order status (e.g., 'processing' -> 'shipped'). Potentially triggers fulfillment events or notifications.
*   **Product Management:** CRUD interface (`/admin/products`, `/admin/categories`, etc.) for managing the catalog. Includes managing variants, inventory levels (manual adjustments), images, and relationships.
*   **User Management:** Basic view of registered customers (`/admin/users`). Ability to search/filter. Role management should be handled with extreme caution, perhaps only allowing specific role changes (e.g., elevating a user to 'staff'). Disabling/Deleting users might be possible.
*   **Data Export:** Uses packages like `maatwebsite/excel` to generate CSV/XLSX exports for orders or customers based on selected filters. Implemented as a queued job for large exports to avoid request timeouts.

### API Capabilities

*   **RESTful API:** Versioned endpoints under `/api/v1/`. Follows REST principles: uses standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), appropriate status codes (200, 201, 404, 422, 401, 403), and resource-oriented URLs (e.g., `/api/v1/products`, `/api/v1/orders/{id}`). Responses use JSON API structure or similar standard via Laravel API Resources. See [API & Service Contracts](#-api--service-contracts-usage-guide).
*   **GraphQL API (Optional):** A single endpoint `/graphql` allows clients to request exactly the data they need. Implemented using libraries like `lighthouse-php`, which uses schema definition language (SDL) in `.graphql` files (`app/GraphQL/schema.graphql`).
*   **Authentication:** API requests are authenticated using Laravel Sanctum's API tokens (issued to users/clients, sent via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header). Webhooks are authenticated using signature verification specific to the provider (e.g., Stripe's `Webhook-Signature` header).
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implemented using Laravel's built-in rate limiting middleware, configured in `App\Http\Kernel.php` or directly on routes/groups. Limits defined per route/group and potentially per user/IP (e.g., 60 requests per minute).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack Rationale

The choice of technologies is crucial for building a modern, maintainable, and performant web application.

### Why Laravel 12?

*   **Developer Productivity & Elegance:** Laravel's expressive syntax, comprehensive features (routing, Eloquent ORM, Blade templating, queues, caching, events, authentication, testing utilities), and focus on developer experience significantly accelerate development. "It just feels right."
*   **Rich Ecosystem:** Access to a vast array of high-quality official packages (Sail, Sanctum, Socialite, Telescope, Cashier, Fortify, Pint, Octane) and a thriving community package ecosystem solves common problems efficiently and reliably.
*   **Strong Community & Documentation:** Outstanding official documentation, Laracasts videos, active forums, and a large global community provide unparalleled support, learning resources, and solutions.
*   **Scalability & Performance:** Built-in support for job queues (Redis, SQS, database), caching (Redis, Memcached, file), task scheduling, database replication configuration, and performance-boosting tools like Laravel Octane make scaling applications manageable.
*   **Security Focus:** Laravel provides built-in protection against common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and SQL injection. It encourages secure coding practices and has a clear process for security releases.

### Why Tailwind CSS 3?

*   **Utility-First Efficiency:** Enables rapid development of custom user interfaces directly in HTML without writing large amounts of custom CSS. Reduces context switching and encourages design consistency.
*   **Highly Configurable & Maintainable:** The `tailwind.config.js` file allows deep customization of the design system (colors, spacing, fonts, breakpoints). Utility classes make HTML verbose but CSS codebase minimal and easy to manage. Design changes often only require config updates.
*   **Performance Optimized:** The Just-in-Time (JIT) engine generates CSS only for the classes actually used in your project templates, resulting in extremely small production CSS files, regardless of the number of utilities defined.
*   **Responsive Design First:** Mobile-first responsive modifiers (`sm:`, `md:`, etc.) are intuitive and make building adaptive layouts straightforward.
*   **Modern Features:** Built-in support for dark mode (`dark:` variant), arbitrary values, CSS Grid, and other modern CSS features streamlines development.

### Why Alpine.js?

*   **Minimal & Lightweight:** Provides reactive and declarative JavaScript behavior directly within HTML templates with a small footprint (~7kB gzipped). Ideal for adding interactivity to server-rendered Blade views without the complexity and overhead of larger frameworks like Vue or React.
*   **Laravel Synergy:** Complements server-side rendering with Blade perfectly. Easy to sprinkle interactivity exactly where needed. Integrates well with Livewire if more complex state management is required later.
*   **Gentle Learning Curve:** Familiar syntax for developers experienced with Vue.js or basic JavaScript DOM manipulation. Directives (`x-data`, `x-on`, `x-bind`, `x-show`, `x-for`, `x-transition`) are intuitive.
*   **Sufficient for Many Use Cases:** Handles common UI tasks like dropdowns, modals, tabs, dynamic form elements, and simple AJAX interactions effectively within a traditional full-stack application context.

### Why PHP 8.3?

*   **Performance Improvements:** PHP 8.x versions offer significant performance gains over previous versions, thanks to optimizations and the JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler (though its impact varies by workload).
*   **Modern Language Features:** Enables cleaner, more expressive, and type-safe code using features like Attributes, Enums, Readonly Properties, Constructor Property Promotion, Union Types, Intersection Types, Fibers (core to Laravel Octane), `final` class constants, typed class constants, and more.
*   **Active Support & Security:** Using the latest stable version ensures ongoing bug fixes, security patches, and access to the newest language capabilities. PHP 8.3 receives active support until late 2026.
*   **Strong Typing:** Enhanced type system helps catch errors early and improves code understanding and maintainability, especially beneficial in larger applications.

### Why MariaDB 11.7?

*   **Performance & Features:** A robust, high-performance, open-source relational database. Often considered a drop-in replacement for MySQL with potential performance advantages in certain workloads and additional features (e.g., enhanced JSON functions, system-versioned tables, advanced clustering options).
*   **Full MySQL Compatibility:** Works seamlessly with Laravel's Eloquent ORM and existing MySQL drivers/tools. Easy migration path from MySQL.
*   **Open Source & Community Driven:** Avoids vendor lock-in associated with proprietary databases. Benefits from active community development and support.
*   **Mature & Reliable:** A proven database technology widely used in production environments for demanding applications.

### Why Docker & Laravel Sail?

*   **Consistent Development Environment:** Docker containers encapsulate the application and its dependencies (PHP, MariaDB, Redis, Mailpit, etc.), ensuring that all developers and CI/CD pipelines operate in the exact same environment, eliminating "it works on my machine" issues.
*   **Simplified Setup & Management:** Laravel Sail provides a lightweight command-line interface (`./vendor/bin/sail`) that abstracts away complex Docker commands for common tasks like starting/stopping containers, running Artisan commands, executing tests, accessing shells, and managing dependencies.
*   **Dependency Isolation:** Prevents conflicts between different project dependencies or versions installed directly on the host operating system. Each project runs in its isolated containerized environment.
*   **Closer Production Parity:** Using containers locally makes containerizing the application for production deployment (e.g., on Fly.io, Kubernetes, ECS) a more natural and consistent step.
*   **Cross-Platform Consistency:** Works reliably across macOS, Windows (with WSL2), and Linux.

### Architectural Layers Explained

1.  **Presentation Layer (Client/Browser):** The user interface rendered in the browser. Comprises HTML generated by Blade views, styled with Tailwind CSS, and made interactive with Alpine.js. Communicates with the backend via HTTP requests (page loads, form submissions, AJAX). Could also be a Single Page Application (SPA) or mobile app consuming the API.

2.  **Web Application Layer (Laravel):** Handles incoming HTTP requests and orchestrates the response.
    *   **Router:** Maps URLs to specific controller actions.
    *   **Middleware:** Intercepts requests to perform cross-cutting concerns like authentication, authorization, CSRF protection, CORS handling, rate limiting, logging, etc.
    *   **Controllers:** Receive validated request data (often via Form Requests), interact with the Domain Layer (via Services or Actions) to perform business operations, and prepare data for the Presentation Layer (selecting a Blade view or returning an API Resource). Controllers should remain thin and focused on HTTP concerns.
    *   **Views / API Resources:** Format data for presentation. Blade views render HTML. API Resources transform Eloquent models or DTOs into standardized JSON structures for API responses.

3.  **Domain Layer (Core Business Logic):** The heart of the application, containing the business rules, logic, and state, independent of frameworks and infrastructure concerns.
    *   **Services/Actions:** Encapsulate specific business processes or use cases (e.g., `PlaceOrderService`, `RegisterUserService`, `AddProductToCartAction`). They coordinate interactions between domain models, repositories, and potentially dispatch domain events. Actions are often finer-grained than Services, representing a single command/task.
    *   **Domain Models (Aggregates):** Represent core business concepts (e.g., `Product`, `Order`, `User`, `Cart`). Implemented primarily using Eloquent models but enriched with business logic methods. An Aggregate is a cluster of domain objects (entities, value objects) treated as a single unit (e.g., an `Order` with its `OrderItems`).
    *   **Value Objects:** Small, immutable objects representing descriptive aspects of the domain without a distinct identity (e.g., `Money`, `Address`, `EmailAddress`). Ensure validity and consistency (e.g., a `Money` object always has an amount and currency).
    *   **Repositories:** Abstract the persistence mechanism. In Laravel, Eloquent often serves as an implicit repository, but explicit Repository interfaces (`ProductRepository`) can be defined (especially within the Domain layer) and implemented in the Infrastructure layer to decouple the domain from Eloquent specifics if needed.
    *   **Domain Events:** Represent significant occurrences within the domain (e.g., `OrderPlaced`, `ProductStockLow`). Used to decouple components; services dispatch events, and listeners react asynchronously or synchronously.
    *   **Domain Exceptions:** Custom exceptions (`ProductNotFoundException`, `InsufficientStockException`) representing specific business rule violations.

4.  **Infrastructure Layer (Persistence, External Services):** Deals with technical concerns and external integrations.
    *   **Persistence:** Implementation of data storage and retrieval, primarily using Eloquent ORM interacting with the MariaDB database. Includes database migrations, seeders, and potentially concrete Repository implementations.
    *   **External Service Adapters:** Code responsible for interacting with third-party services like payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal SDKs), email services (Mailgun API client), file storage (AWS S3 SDK), search services (Algolia client), etc. These adapters implement interfaces defined possibly in the Domain or Application layer.
    *   **Queue Implementation:** Configuration and interaction with the chosen queue driver (Redis, Database, SQS) for background job processing.

5.  **Async Processing Layer (Queue Workers):** Processes background jobs dispatched to the queue.
    *   **Queue Workers:** Long-running processes (managed by Supervisor or Horizon) that listen for jobs on the queue and execute them. Jobs often involve interacting back with the Service Layer to perform tasks like sending emails, processing payments, generating reports, etc., without blocking web requests.

### Design Philosophy: DDD Influences

While not a strict DDD implementation, this project borrows key concepts:

*   **Ubiquitous Language:** Strive to use terms from the business domain (aromatherapy, essential oils, blends, wellness, orders, customers) consistently in code (class names, methods, variables) and discussions.
*   **Bounded Contexts (Implicit):** The `app/Domain` directory structure encourages organizing code by business capability (e.g., `app/Domain/Catalog`, `app/Domain/Orders`, `app/Domain/Users`). Each context contains related Models, Services, Events, DTOs, etc.
*   **Layered Architecture:** Clear separation between domain logic, application logic, and infrastructure concerns enhances testability and maintainability.
*   **Aggregates:** Thinking of entities like `Order` and its `OrderItems` as a single transactional unit helps maintain consistency.
*   **Value Objects:** Using Value Objects like `Money` or `Address` improves code clarity, ensures validity, and reduces primitive obsession.
*   **Domain Events:** Decouple parts of the system, allowing reactions to significant business occurrences without direct coupling (e.g., updating inventory or sending notifications when an `OrderPlaced` event occurs).

---

## üß© Core Concepts & Design Patterns Employed

Understanding these patterns is key to working effectively with the codebase.

*   **Model-View-Controller (MVC):** The foundational pattern provided by Laravel.
    *   **Model:** Represents the data and business logic (Eloquent Models, Domain Models). Interacts with the database.
    *   **View:** Presents the data to the user (Blade templates, API Resources).
    *   **Controller:** Handles user input (HTTP requests), interacts with Models (often via Services/Actions), and selects the View/Response.
    *   **Why:** Provides a standard structure for web applications, separating concerns for better organization.

*   **Service Layer Pattern:** Business logic is encapsulated within Service classes (`app/Domain/.../Services`) or Action classes (`app/Domain/.../Actions`).
    *   **Why:** Keeps controllers thin and focused on HTTP. Centralizes business logic, making it reusable and easier to test independently of HTTP context. Promotes the Single Responsibility Principle.

*   **Repository Pattern (Implicit via Eloquent):** Abstracts data persistence. Eloquent models and query builder act as the primary repository implementation. Explicit Repository interfaces (`app/Domain/.../Contracts/ProductRepository.php`) can be defined for complex queries or to decouple the domain layer further from Eloquent if necessary, with implementations in `app/Infrastructure/Persistence/Eloquent`.
    *   **Why:** Decouples business logic from data storage details (though less strictly with Eloquent's active record nature). Allows swapping persistence mechanisms (theoretically) and simplifies testing by mocking repositories.

*   **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Simple objects used to transfer data between layers (e.g., from HTTP Requests to Services/Actions, or from Services to Views/API Resources). Often immutable. Can be implemented as simple PHP classes, potentially using `spatie/laravel-data`.
    *   **Why:** Provide clear data contracts between components, improve type safety, and decouple internal domain model structure from external APIs or view requirements. Useful for handling validated request data.

*   **Dependency Injection & Service Container:** Laravel's Service Container automatically resolves and injects dependencies (like Services, Repositories) into controllers, listeners, jobs, etc., usually via constructor or method injection. Type-hinting interfaces allows for easy swapping of implementations.
    *   **Why:** Promotes loose coupling, makes components easier to test (by injecting mocks), and manages object lifecycles. Central to Laravel's architecture.

*   **Events & Listeners (Decoupling):** Application components can dispatch events (`OrderPlaced`) without knowing which other parts of the system need to react. Listeners (`SendOrderConfirmationEmail`, `UpdateInventoryListener`) subscribe to these events and perform actions.
    *   **Why:** Decouples components significantly. Allows adding new reactions to domain events without modifying the original event dispatcher. Facilitates asynchronous processing by queuing listeners.

*   **Middleware (HTTP Request Handling):** Classes that process HTTP requests before they reach the controller or after the response is generated. Used for concerns like authentication, logging, CORS, CSRF protection, request modification. Defined in `app/Http/Middleware` and registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
    *   **Why:** Provides a layered approach to handling cross-cutting HTTP concerns cleanly and reuseably across multiple routes.

### Sequence Narrative & Technical Details

1.  **Initiate Checkout (Frontend):** User clicks "Checkout" in the cart (likely a Blade view with Alpine.js). An Alpine function triggers an asynchronous `POST` request (using `fetch` or Axios) to a backend endpoint like `/api/v1/checkout/prepare`.
2.  **Prepare Checkout (Backend):** The `CartController::prepareCheckout` method (or similar) receives the request. It might perform initial validation (e.g., cart not empty).
3.  **Validate Cart:** The controller calls a `CartValidationService` (or logic within `CheckoutService`) to ensure items are still in stock, prices are current, etc. If invalid, it returns a 4xx error response.
4.  **Initiate Payment (Backend):** If the cart is valid, the controller calls `CheckoutService::initiateCheckout`. This service:
    *   Calculates the final total (including shipping, taxes, discounts).
    *   Interacts with the Stripe SDK (`stripe/stripe-php`) to create a `PaymentIntent` on Stripe's servers with the calculated amount and currency.
    *   Stripe API returns a `PaymentIntent` object containing a `client_secret`.
    *   The service returns the `client_secret` and potentially other checkout details (order summary, available shipping methods) back to the controller.
    *   The controller returns a 200 JSON response containing the `client_secret` and checkout data.
5.  **Render Payment Form (Frontend):** The initial AJAX request succeeds. The frontend (Alpine.js) uses the received `client_secret` and checkout data to:
    *   Potentially redirect the user to the main checkout page (`/checkout`).
    *   Initialize Stripe Elements (using `stripe.js`) to render secure card input fields. The `client_secret` is passed to Stripe Elements.
6.  **Submit Payment (Frontend):** User fills in their card details and clicks "Pay Now". Alpine.js calls `stripe.confirmCardPayment(client_secret, { payment_method: { card: cardElement, ... } })`. Stripe.js securely sends the card details and `client_secret` directly to Stripe's API (never touching our server).
7.  **Webhook Notification (Backend - Stripe -> Server):** Stripe processes the payment. Independently, Stripe sends a webhook event (e.g., `payment_intent.succeeded`) to a pre-configured endpoint on our server (`/webhooks/stripe`). The `StripeWebhookController::handlePaymentIntentSucceeded` method receives this POST request.
8.  **Verify Webhook Signature:** The controller *must* verify the webhook signature using the secret key (`STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` from `.env`) and the `Stripe-Signature` header provided in the request. This ensures the request genuinely came from Stripe. Laravel Cashier provides helpers, or use `\Stripe\Webhook::constructEvent()`. If invalid, return a 400/403 error.
9.  **Queue Order Processing Job:** If the signature is valid, the controller extracts the `PaymentIntent` ID (or the full object) from the webhook payload. It then dispatches a job, e.g., `ProcessSuccessfulOrderJob::dispatch($paymentIntentId)`, to the queue. This acknowledges the webhook quickly (returning 200 OK to Stripe) and defers the actual order creation.
10. **Job Execution (Background):** A queue worker (`php artisan queue:work` or Horizon) picks up the `ProcessSuccessfulOrderJob` from the queue (e.g., Redis).
11. **Create Order (Background):** The job's `handle` method typically resolves an `OrderService` from the container. It calls a method like `OrderService::createOrderFromPayment($paymentIntentId)`. This service:
    *   Retrieves payment details from Stripe again if needed (or uses data passed in the job).
    *   Retrieves the associated cart data (e.g., from the database or potentially linked via PaymentIntent metadata).
    *   Creates the `Order` record in the database with status 'processing'.
    *   Creates associated `OrderItem` records, capturing product details and prices at the time of purchase.
    *   Clears the user's cart.
    *   Dispatches a domain event, e.g., `OrderPlaced::dispatch($order)`.
12. **React to OrderPlaced Event (Background):**
    *   `UpdateInventoryListener`: Listens for `OrderPlaced`. Gets the order items and decrements the stock levels in the `inventory_levels` table for each purchased item/variant.
    *   `SendOrderConfirmationEmailListener`: Listens for `OrderPlaced`. Dispatches *another* job (`SendOrderConfirmationEmailJob::dispatch($order)`) to queue the sending of the confirmation email (using Laravel Mail, potentially with Mailgun/SES driver).
13. **Confirm Success (Frontend):** Meanwhile, back in the browser, the `stripe.confirmCardPayment` call in Step 6 either resolves successfully (if payment was synchronous and successful) or potentially requires further action (e.g., 3D Secure). Assuming success, Alpine.js transitions the UI, often redirecting the user to a "Thank You" page (`/checkout/success/{order_id}`) displaying the order summary. This page might poll briefly or rely on the eventual consistency provided by the webhook processing.

## üóÇÔ∏è Directory & File Layout Explained

The project follows the standard Laravel directory structure, with key customizations primarily within the `app` directory to support a domain-centric approach.

### Standard Laravel Structure

Familiar directories like `bootstrap`, `config`, `database`, `public`, `resources`, `routes`, `storage`, `tests`, and `vendor` retain their standard Laravel purposes.

*   `config/`: Application configuration files.
*   `database/`: Migrations, seeders, factories.
*   `public/`: Web server document root, compiled assets (`build/`), `index.php`.
*   `resources/`: Frontend source files (CSS, JS, Blade views, language files).
*   `routes/`: Route definitions (`web.php`, `api.php`, `console.php`).
*   `storage/`: Compiled views, session files, caches, logs, user uploads (if local driver used).
*   `tests/`: Application tests (Unit, Feature).

### Key Customizations (`app/Domain`)

The most significant customization is the introduction of the `app/Domain` directory. This structure helps organize code based on business capabilities or "Bounded Contexts" from DDD.

### Directory Breakdown

*   **`app/Console`**: Artisan commands (e.g., `php artisan app:import-products`).
*   **`app/Domain/<Context>`**: Houses the core logic for a specific business area. Promotes modularity and separation of concerns. Reduces coupling between different parts of the application.
*   **`app/Http/Controllers`**: Kept thin. Delegates business logic to Services/Actions in the Domain layer. Handles HTTP request/response lifecycle. API controllers might live in `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1`.
*   **`app/Http/Middleware`**: Standard Laravel middleware for HTTP request processing.
*   **`app/Http/Requests`**: Form Request classes for validating incoming HTTP request data before it reaches the controller.
*   **`app/Http/Resources`**: API Resource classes for transforming models/DTOs into JSON responses for the API.
*   **`app/Jobs`**: Application-wide or infrastructure-related jobs. Domain-specific jobs might live within `app/Domain/<Context>/Jobs`.
*   **`app/Listeners`**: Listeners reacting to events (often Domain Events). Can be organized by event type.
*   **`app/Mail`**: Mailable classes representing specific emails.
*   **`app/Models`**: Contains core, cross-cutting Eloquent models like `User`. Domain-specific models reside within `app/Domain/<Context>/Models`.
*   **`app/Policies`**: Authorization logic for models.
*   **`app/Providers`**: Service providers, including `EventServiceProvider` where events and listeners are mapped. Custom providers might register domain services or repository bindings.
*   **`tests/Unit`**: Unit tests, often testing classes in isolation (Services, Value Objects, Actions). Should not hit the database or external services. May test classes within `app/Domain`.
*   **`tests/Feature`**: Feature tests, testing application features from the outside in (usually via HTTP requests). Simulate user interactions and assert responses/database state.

### Data Modeling Choices & Rationale

*   **Product Variants:** A separate `product_variants` table allows distinct SKUs, prices (overrides), attributes, and inventory tracking for variations of a base product. Essential for selling items in different sizes, scents, etc.
*   **Inventory Levels:** `inventory_levels` tracks stock per variant (and potentially warehouse). This separation allows complex inventory logic without cluttering the product/variant tables. Using `UNSIGNED` prevents negative stock at the DB level (though application logic should handle this gracefully).
*   **Order Item Snapshot:** `order_items.product_snapshot` (JSON) stores crucial product details (name, SKU, price, attributes) *at the time the order was placed*. This prevents historical orders from changing if product details are updated later. FKs to `products`/`product_variants` are kept mainly for reporting convenience.
*   **Addresses:** A dedicated `addresses` table allows users to save multiple addresses and reuse them for billing/shipping. Orders link to specific address records used for that transaction. Guest checkout addresses might be stored here temporarily or directly on the order (denormalized) if preferred simplicity over normalization. Using `country_code` standardizes country representation.
*   **JSON Columns:** Used judiciously for flexible data like `product_variants.attributes` or `products.meta_data` where structure might vary or is less critical for direct querying/indexing. MariaDB has good JSON support.
*   **ENUMs:** Used for fields with a fixed, small set of possible values like `orders.status` or `users.role`. Provides data integrity and readability. Can sometimes be debated vs. lookup tables or constants in code.
*   **Decimal for Money:** Using `DECIMAL(10, 2)` (or similar precision) is crucial for storing currency values accurately, avoiding floating-point arithmetic issues.

### Migrations & Seeding Strategy

*   **Migrations:** Organized chronologically in `database/migrations`. Follow Laravel's standard naming convention (`YYYY_MM_DD_HHMMSS_create_table_name.php`).
    *   Use foreign key constraints (`foreignId(...)->constrained()->onDelete(...)`) to maintain relational integrity. Define appropriate `onDelete` behavior (e.g., `cascade`, `set null`, `restrict`).
    *   Add indexes (`index()`, `unique()`) to frequently queried columns (foreign keys, slugs, emails, status fields).
*   **Seeding:** Located in `database/seeders`.
    *   `DatabaseSeeder.php` orchestrates the seeding process, calling other seeder classes.
    *   Create specific seeders for different data types (e.g., `UserSeeder`, `CategorySeeder`, `ProductSeeder`, `OrderSeeder` for dummy data).
    *   Use Model Factories (`database/factories`) to generate realistic fake data efficiently.
    *   Seeders are essential for setting up local development environments and potentially for populating initial production data (like roles, default settings).
    *   Run seeds via `./vendor/bin/sail php artisan db:seed` or `./vendor/bin/sail php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`.

## üîå API & Service Contracts: Usage Guide

The application exposes a RESTful API for potential frontend frameworks, mobile apps, or third-party integrations, alongside webhook endpoints for external services.

### API Philosophy (RESTful, Versioned)

*   **RESTful Principles:** Adheres to standard REST conventions:
    *   Resource-based URLs (e.g., `/api/v1/products`, `/api/v1/orders/{id}`).
    *   Standard HTTP Verbs (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE).
    *   Standard HTTP Status Codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 401, 403, 404, 422, 500).
    *   Stateless communication (each request contains all necessary info).
    *   JSON for request/response bodies. Responses formatted using [Laravel API Resources](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-resources) for consistency (e.g., including `data`, `links`, `meta` where appropriate).
*   **Versioning:** API is versioned via URL segment (`/api/v1/`). This allows introducing breaking changes in future versions (`/api/v2/`) without affecting existing clients.

### Authentication Mechanisms

1.  **API Tokens (Laravel Sanctum):** For users interacting via SPAs or mobile apps.
    *   **Issuance:** Tokens are typically issued upon login. Users can generate persistent API tokens via their profile settings for external scripts/services.
    *   **Usage:** Clients must include the token in the `Authorization` header of each request:
        ```http
        Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_TOKEN>
        Accept: application/json
        ```
    *   **Scope:** Tokens can potentially have scopes (permissions) assigned for fine-grained access control, although not implemented by default in v1.0.

2.  **Webhook Signatures (Example: Stripe):** For authenticating incoming webhook requests from external services.
    *   **Mechanism:** Services like Stripe sign their webhook requests using a secret key shared between the service and our application (`STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env`).
    *   **Verification:** Our webhook controller (`StripeWebhookController`) must:
        1.  Retrieve the signature from the request header (e.g., `Stripe-Signature`).
        2.  Retrieve the raw request payload.
        3.  Use the service's SDK or provided algorithm (e.g., `\Stripe\Webhook::constructEvent()`) along with the shared secret to verify that the signature matches the payload.
    *   **Importance:** CRITICAL for security. Prevents attackers from sending fake webhook events to trigger actions (like marking an order as paid).

### GraphQL Endpoint

*   **Location:** `/graphql` (Optional - if implemented)
*   **Implementation:** Uses `lighthouse-php` package.
*   **Schema:** Defined in `app/GraphQL/schema.graphql` and potentially supporting files.
*   **Usage:** Clients send POST requests to `/graphql` with a JSON body containing the `query` (and optionally `variables`).
    ```json
    // Request Body
    {
      "query": "query GetProduct($slug: String!) { product(slug: $slug) { id name description price variants { id name price } } }",
      "variables": {
        "slug": "lavender-essential-oil"
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Benefits:** Allows clients to fetch exactly the data they need in a single request, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching. Good for complex frontend scenarios.

### API Versioning

*   **Strategy:** URL Path Segment (`/api/v1/`).
*   **Rationale:** Explicit, easy to route, easy for clients to understand and use. Caching proxies can differentiate versions easily.
*   **Future Versions:** Introduce `/api/v2/` for breaking changes. Maintain `/api/v1/` for backward compatibility for a defined period.

### Rate Limiting

*   **Implementation:** Uses Laravel's built-in Throttle middleware (`throttle`).
*   **Configuration:** Defined in `app/Http/Kernel.php` (global or route groups like 'api') or directly on routes using `->middleware('throttle:60,1')` (60 requests per 1 minute). Can be customized further (e.g., based on authenticated user ID).
*   **Response:** When limits are exceeded, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` status code with `Retry-After` and `X-RateLimit-*` headers.

### API Documentation (OpenAPI)

*   **Format:** OpenAPI 3.x specification.
*   **Location:** `docs/openapi.yaml` (or `.json`) in the repository root.
*   **Generation/Maintenance:**
    *   Can be written manually.
    *   **Recommended:** Generate from code annotations using tools like `zircote/swagger-php`. Add PHP attributes or docblocks to controllers, requests, and resources. Run a command (e.g., `php artisan swagger:generate`) to create/update `openapi.yaml`.
*   **Serving Docs:** Use tools like Swagger UI or Redoc to render the `openapi.yaml` file into interactive HTML documentation. This can be served as a static page or via a simple controller route (e.g., `/api/documentation`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration In-Depth

Application behavior is heavily influenced by environment variables, primarily managed through the `.env` file.

### The `.env` File

*   Location: Project root. **Crucially, `.env` should NEVER be committed to version control.**
*   Source: Created by copying `.env.example` (`cp .env.example .env`).
*   Purpose: Stores environment-specific configuration and sensitive credentials (API keys, database passwords). Laravel uses the `vlucas/phpdotenv` package to load these variables into the environment (`$_ENV`, `$_SERVER`) when the application boots.
*   Precedence: Variables defined directly in the server environment (e.g., via Docker, system variables, PaaS settings) typically override values in the `.env` file.

### Core Application Settings

```dotenv
# .env Example Snippets

# Application Identity & Environment
APP_NAME="The Scent" # Used in UI, emails, etc. Use quotes if spaces exist.
APP_ENV=local       # Environment: local, development, testing, production. Affects error reporting, service providers loading, etc.
APP_KEY=base64:...  # MUST be set (use `php artisan key:generate`). Used for encryption/hashing. 32 bytes base64 encoded.
APP_DEBUG=true      # Enable detailed error pages (true in local/dev, FALSE in production).
APP_URL=http://localhost # Base URL for the application (used for generating links, asset URLs). Set to actual domain in production.

# Logging
LOG_CHANNEL=stack     # Default log channel (stack, single, daily, slack, etc.)
LOG_DEPRECATIONS_CHANNEL=null # Where to send deprecation warnings (null to ignore)
LOG_LEVEL=debug       # Minimum log level to record (debug, info, notice, warning, error, critical, alert, emergency). Set higher (e.g., 'error') in production.
```

### Database Connection

```dotenv
DB_CONNECTION=mariadb       # Database driver (mysql, pgsql, sqlite, sqlsrv). Sail uses 'mysql' effectively for MariaDB.
DB_HOST=mariadb             # Database host. 'mariadb' is the service name in Sail's docker-compose.yml. Use 127.0.0.1 if connecting to host machine DB.
DB_PORT=3306                # Database port.
DB_DATABASE=the_scent       # Database name.
DB_USERNAME=sail            # Database username (defined in docker-compose.yml for Sail).
DB_PASSWORD=password        # Database password (defined in docker-compose.yml for Sail).

# Optional: Separate Read/Write connections for replication
# DB_READ_HOST=...
# DB_WRITE_HOST=...
```

### Session, Cache, Queue Drivers

```dotenv
# Session Management (User login state, flash messages)
SESSION_DRIVER=file         # Driver: file, cookie, database, redis, memcached, array. 'redis' is recommended for scalability.
SESSION_LIFETIME=120        # Session duration in minutes.
SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=null  # Set true if using HTTPS only (recommended for production). Auto-detects usually works.

# Caching (Application data, query results)
CACHE_DRIVER=file           # Driver: file, database, redis, memcached, array, apc. 'redis' is recommended for performance.
CACHE_PREFIX=the_scent_cache # Prefix for cache keys to avoid collisions.

# Queue / Background Jobs
QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync       # Driver: sync (runs immediately - dev only!), database, redis, beanstalkd, sqs. 'redis' or 'database' common.
# For Redis:
REDIS_HOST=redis            # Redis host (service name in Sail).
REDIS_PASSWORD=null         # Redis password (if set).
REDIS_PORT=6379             # Redis port.
```

### External Service Keys (Mail, Payments)

```dotenv
# Mail Sending (Password Resets, Order Confirmations)
MAIL_MAILER=smtp            # Driver: smtp, ses, mailgun, postmark, sendmail, log, array. 'mailpit' used by Sail for local dev trapping.
MAIL_HOST=mailpit           # SMTP Host (mailpit service in Sail). Use actual provider's host in prod.
MAIL_PORT=1025              # SMTP Port (mailpit port). Use provider's port (e.g., 587) in prod.
MAIL_USERNAME=null          # SMTP Username (if required by provider).
MAIL_PASSWORD=null          # SMTP Password (if required by provider).
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null        # Encryption: null, tls, ssl. Use 'tls' usually.
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="hello@thescent.example.com" # Default sender email. MUST BE VERIFIED DOMAIN FOR PRODUCTION SENDING
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"                  # Default sender name.

# Stripe Payment Gateway
STRIPE_KEY=pk_test_...        # Stripe Publishable Key (used in frontend JS). Use pk_live... in production.
STRIPE_SECRET=sk_test_...     # Stripe Secret Key (used in backend). Use sk_live... in production. NEVER expose this.
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... # Stripe Webhook Signing Secret. Get from Stripe dashboard.

# PayPal Payment Gateway (if used)
PAYPAL_MODE=sandbox         # 'sandbox' or 'live'.
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=...
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=...
PAYPAL_APP_ID=...           # For webhooks potentially

# Other Services (e.g., Algolia Search, AWS S3)
# ALGOLIA_APP_ID=...
# ALGOLIA_SECRET=...
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
# AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
# AWS_BUCKET=...
# FILESYSTEM_DISK=s3 # Set default filesystem disk
```

### Feature Flags

A simple way to toggle features on/off via environment variables.

```dotenv
# Example Feature Flags (Used in code via `config('features.wishlist')` or `env('FEATURE_WISHLIST', false)`)
FEATURE_WISHLIST=false
FEATURE_REVIEWS=false
FEATURE_SUBSCRIPTIONS=false
```
*Note: For more robust feature flagging, consider packages like `laravel-feature` or `fflip` or integrating with a service like LaunchDarkly. Create a `config/features.php` file to read these env vars for cleaner access: `return ['wishlist' => env('FEATURE_WISHLIST', false), ...];`*

### Configuration Caching (`config:cache`)

*   Command: `./vendor/bin/sail php artisan config:cache`
*   Action: Combines all configuration files (`config/*.php`) into a single cached file (`bootstrap/cache/config.php`).
*   Benefit: Significantly speeds up application bootstrapping, especially noticeable in production, as Laravel doesn't need to parse all individual config files on every request.
*   **IMPORTANT:**
    *   Should **only** be used as part of your **deployment process**.
    *   After running `config:cache`, changes to `.env` file values will **not** be reflected until you clear the cache (`php artisan config:clear`) and re-cache. The `env()` function should generally **not** be used directly in your code outside of config files; use the `config()` helper (e.g., `config('app.name')`, `config('services.stripe.secret')`) which reads from the cached file in production.
    *   Run `php artisan config:clear` during development if you change config files or `.env` values.

### Environment Validation

Ensuring required environment variables are set and valid is crucial, especially before deployment.

*   **Manual Check:** Carefully review `.env` against `.env.example`.
*   **Programmatic Validation (Recommended):**
    *   Use Laravel 11+'s built-in environment validation features if applicable, or:
    *   Use a dedicated Service Provider (e.g., `EnvironmentValidationServiceProvider`) that runs early in the bootstrap process.
    *   In the provider's `register` or `boot` method, check for the existence and basic format of critical variables using `config()` (after config is loaded) or `env()` cautiously. Throw an exception if a required variable is missing or invalid.
    *   Example check:
        ```php
        // In a Service Provider's boot method
        if (empty(config('services.stripe.secret'))) {
            throw new \RuntimeException('Missing required configuration: services.stripe.secret (check STRIPE_SECRET in .env)');
        }
        if (!filter_var(config('app.url'), FILTER_VALIDATE_URL)) {
             throw new \RuntimeException('Invalid APP_URL format in environment configuration.');
        }
        // etc. for DB credentials, mail settings...
        ```
    *   Consider using packages like `laravel-env-validator` for more structured validation rules.

## üöÄ Comprehensive Local Development Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run the project locally using Docker and Laravel Sail.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Docker:**
    *   **macOS:** [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
    *   **Windows:** [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) (requires WSL 2 backend - usually enabled during installation).
    *   **Linux:** [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
    *   Ensure the Docker daemon is running.
2.  **Git:** Required for cloning the repository. ([Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)).
3.  **Composer:** Required for installing PHP dependencies initially to get Sail. ([Install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)). You only need it on your host machine to install Sail itself; subsequent composer commands run inside Sail/Docker.
4.  **Node.js & npm:** Required on your host machine if you want to run frontend commands (`npm run dev`, etc.) directly, although it's recommended to run them via Sail. Sail's PHP container includes Node and npm. ([Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).
5.  **Code Editor:** VS Code (with extensions like PHP Intelephense, Docker, Remote - Containers), PhpStorm, or your preferred editor.

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
# Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL from GitHub
git clone <repository-url> the-scent
cd the-scent
```

### Setting Up Laravel Sail (Docker)

Laravel Sail is included as a `dev` dependency. First, install Composer dependencies locally to make the `sail` script available.

```bash
# Install PHP dependencies including Sail
composer install --ignore-platform-reqs # Ignore platform reqs needed if host PHP version differs
```
*Note: `--ignore-platform-reqs` is often needed initially if your local PHP version doesn't match the project's requirements, as Sail will use the correct version inside Docker anyway.*

### Initial Bootstrap Commands

1.  **Copy Environment File:** Create your local `.env` file from the example.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    *Review the `.env` file. The default settings provided by Sail (`DB_HOST=mariadb`, `DB_USERNAME=sail`, `DB_PASSWORD=password`, `REDIS_HOST=redis`, `MAIL_HOST=mailpit`) should work out-of-the-box with the default `docker-compose.yml`.*

2.  **Start Sail Containers:** This command builds the Docker images (if not already built) and starts the containers defined in `docker-compose.yml` (PHP, MariaDB, Redis, Mailpit, etc.) in detached mode (`-d`).
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
    ```
    *(The first run might take several minutes to download and build the images).*

3.  **Generate Application Key:** Set the `APP_KEY` in your `.env` file.
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
    ```

4.  **Run Database Migrations & Seeders:** Create the database schema and populate it with initial/dummy data.
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate --seed
    ```

5.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:** Install CSS/JS packages defined in `package.json`.
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start Vite Development Server:** Compile frontend assets (Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js) and enable Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for instant browser updates during development.
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev
    ```
    *Keep this process running in a separate terminal tab.*

2.  **Access the Application:** Open your web browser and navigate to the `APP_URL` defined in your `.env` file, which defaults to:
    *   **http://localhost**

    You should see The Scent application's landing page.

3.  **Access Mailpit (Email Catching):** Sail includes Mailpit for trapping outgoing emails during local development. Access its web interface at:
    *   **http://localhost:8025**

### Working with Sail: Common Commands

Sail commands execute within the main application (PHP) container.

*   **Start Containers:** `./vendor/bin/sail up -d`
*   **Stop Containers:** `./vendor/bin/sail down`
*   **Run Artisan Commands:** `./vendor/bin/sail artisan <command>` (e.g., `list`, `route:list`, `make:controller`)
*   **Run Composer Commands:** `./vendor/bin/sail composer <command>` (e.g., `require`, `update`, `dump-autoload`)
*   **Run npm/Node Commands:** `./vendor/bin/sail npm <command>` (e.g., `install`, `run build`), `./vendor/bin/sail node <script.js>`
*   **Run PHPUnit/Pest Tests:** `./vendor/bin/sail test` or `./vendor/bin/sail pest`
*   **Open Tinker Shell:** `./vendor/bin/sail artisan tinker`
*   **Open Bash Shell in PHP Container:** `./vendor/bin/sail shell`
*   **Access MariaDB CLI:** `./vendor/bin/sail mariadb` (Prompts for the password defined in `.env`, default 'password')
*   **Access Redis CLI:** `./vendor/bin/sail redis-cli`
*   **Execute Arbitrary Commands:** `./vendor/bin/sail <command>` (e.g., `./vendor/bin/sail php -v`)
*   **Rebuild Docker Images:** `./vendor/bin/sail build --no-cache` (If Dockerfile changes)

*Alias (Optional): For convenience, you can add a bash alias: `alias sail='[ -f sail ] && bash sail || bash vendor/bin/sail'` to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`, allowing you to just type `sail <command>`.*

### Frontend Asset Pipeline (Vite)

*   **Development:** `sail npm run dev` (Starts Vite dev server with HMR).
*   **Production Build:** `sail npm run build` (Compiles and minifies assets for production into `public/build`).
*   **Configuration:** `vite.config.js` defines how assets are processed. `tailwind.config.js` configures Tailwind CSS. `resources/css/app.css` and `resources/js/app.js` are the main entry points.

### Database Interaction (Sail & GUI Tools)

*   **Sail CLI:** Use `./vendor/bin/sail mariadb` for direct SQL interaction.
*   **GUI Tools (TablePlus, DBeaver, Sequel Ace, DataGrip):** You can connect to the MariaDB container using a GUI tool. The database is exposed on your host machine via the port defined in `docker-compose.yml` (usually 3306 maps to 3306).
    *   Host: `127.0.0.1` (or `localhost`)
    *   Port: `3306` (or the host port specified in `docker-compose.yml` if different)
    *   Username: `sail` (or `DB_USERNAME` from `.env`)
    *   Password: `password` (or `DB_PASSWORD` from `.env`)
    *   Database: `the_scent` (or `DB_DATABASE` from `.env`)

### Debugging with Xdebug & Sail

Sail's PHP container includes Xdebug, but it's often disabled by default for performance.

1.  **Enable Xdebug:** Set the `SAIL_XDEBUG_MODE` variable in your `.env` file. Common modes:
    *   `SAIL_XDEBUG_MODE=develop,debug` (Enables development helpers and step debugging)
    *   `SAIL_XDEBUG_MODE=off` (Disables Xdebug - default usually)
    ```dotenv
    # .env
    SAIL_XDEBUG_MODE=develop,debug
    SAIL_XDEBUG_CONFIG="client_host=host.docker.internal" # Tells Xdebug where your IDE is listening
    ```
    *Note: `host.docker.internal` is a special DNS name Docker provides for containers to connect back to the host.*

2.  **Restart Sail:** Apply the environment variable change.
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail down
    ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
    ```

3.  **Configure IDE:**
    *   **VS Code:** Install the "PHP Debug" extension by Xdebug. Create a `launch.json` file in `.vscode`:
        ```json
        // .vscode/launch.json
        {
            "version": "0.2.0",
            "configurations": [
                {
                    "name": "Listen for Xdebug",
                    "type": "php",
                    "request": "launch",
                    "port": 9003 // Default Xdebug port
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
    *   **PhpStorm:** Usually detects Xdebug automatically. Go to `Run > Start Listening for PHP Debug Connections`. Set breakpoints in your code.

4.  **Start Debugging:** Start the listener in your IDE, set breakpoints, and make a request to your application (e.g., load a page in the browser). Your IDE should pause execution at the breakpoint.

### Running Tests Locally

*   **Run all tests (Unit & Feature):**
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail test
    ```
    *(Or `./vendor/bin/sail pest` if Pest is the primary runner)*

*   **Run only Unit tests:**
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail test --testsuite=Unit
    # Or if tests are filtered by directory/namespace:
    # ./vendor/bin/sail test --filter=Tests\\Unit
    ```

*   **Run only Feature tests:**
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail test --testsuite=Feature
    # Or if tests are filtered by directory/namespace:
    # ./vendor/bin/sail test --filter=Tests\\Feature
    ```

*   **Run a specific test file:**
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail test tests/Feature/Auth/AuthenticationTest.php
    ```

*   **Run a specific test method:**
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail test --filter=AuthenticationTest::test_users_can_authenticate_using_the_login_screen
    ```

*   **Generate Code Coverage:**
    ```bash
    # Ensure Xdebug is enabled with coverage mode (e.g., SAIL_XDEBUG_MODE=coverage or develop,debug,coverage) and restart Sail
    # Alternatively, install PCOV driver for faster coverage: sail composer require pcov/clobber --dev; then enable pcov in php.ini
    ./vendor/bin/sail test --coverage-html=coverage_report
    # Open coverage_report/index.html in your browser
    ```

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

*   **Permission Errors (Storage/Bootstrap):** If you see errors about writing to `storage` or `bootstrap/cache`, try running:
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail shell
    # Inside the container:
    chown -R sail:sail /var/www/html/storage /var/www/html/bootstrap/cache
    chmod -R 775 /var/www/html/storage /var/www/html/bootstrap/cache
    exit
    ```
*   **"Connection Refused" (Database/Redis):** Ensure Sail containers are running (`sail up -d`). Check `.env` credentials match `docker-compose.yml`. Try restarting Sail (`sail down && sail up -d`).
*   **Slow Performance:** Ensure Docker Desktop has sufficient memory/CPU allocated in its settings. Ensure Xdebug is off (`SAIL_XDEBUG_MODE=off`) when not actively debugging.
*   **Cache Issues:** Clear various caches if things seem stuck:
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail artisan optimize:clear
    # includes: config:clear, route:clear, view:clear, event:clear, compiled:clear
    ./vendor/bin/sail artisan cache:clear
    ```
*   **Docker Network Issues:** Sometimes Docker networks get confused. Try:
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail down --volumes # Stop and remove volumes (WARNING: DELETES DB DATA!)
    docker system prune -a # Warning: Deletes ALL unused Docker data. Use cautiously.
    ./vendor/bin/sail build --no-cache
    ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
    # Re-run bootstrap commands (migrate, seed, etc.)
    ```
*   **Vite HMR Not Working:** Ensure `npm run dev` is running. Check browser console for errors. Ensure `APP_URL` in `.env` is correct. Check Vite config (`vite.config.js`). Ensure `APP_URL` and `VITE_PUSHER_HOST` (if using websockets) point to `localhost` for the browser.

## üß™ Robust Testing Strategy & Implementation

A comprehensive testing strategy is vital for ensuring application quality, stability, and maintainability. We aim for a balanced testing pyramid.

### Testing Philosophy

*   **Test Pyramid:** Focus heavily on fast Unit tests, have a good suite of Feature tests covering user flows and API endpoints, and supplement with a smaller number of critical End-to-End (E2E) tests for key user journeys.
*   **TDD/BDD Influence:** Write tests before or alongside application code where practical. Tests should clarify requirements and drive design.
*   **Meaningful Coverage:** Aim for high *meaningful* code coverage (e.g., > 80-90% for critical domain/service logic), but don't chase numbers blindly. Focus on testing business logic, edge cases, and integration points.
*   **Readability & Maintainability:** Tests are code too. Write clear, concise, and well-structured tests that are easy to understand and maintain. Use descriptive test names.
*   **CI Integration:** All tests (Static Analysis, Unit, Feature) *must* pass in the CI pipeline before code is merged. E2E tests may run on a staging environment or less frequently.

### Unit Tests (Pest/PHPUnit)

*   **Location:** `tests/Unit`
*   **Framework:** [Pest](https://pestphp.com/) (built on PHPUnit) is preferred for its expressive syntax, but standard PHPUnit syntax is also fine.
*   **Purpose:** Test individual classes (Services, Actions, Value Objects, Helpers, simple Models) in isolation. Focus on business logic within a class.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Fast execution.
    *   No external dependencies (Database, Cache, APIs) - Use Mocking/Stubs extensively.
    *   Laravel's container can be used for dependency injection, but avoid booting the full framework if possible for speed. Use `RefreshDatabase` trait *only if absolutely necessary* for testing Eloquent model scopes or simple relations without hitting a real DB (uses in-memory SQLite or transaction rollback).
*   **Example (Pest):**
    ```php
    // tests/Unit/Domain/Orders/ValueObjects/MoneyTest.php
    use App\Domain\Orders\ValueObjects\Money;
    use App\Domain\Orders\Exceptions\InvalidCurrencyException;
    use Brick\Money\Currency; // Assuming use of brick/money

    it('can be created with valid amount and currency', function () {
        $money = Money::ofMinor(1000, 'USD'); // Use a library like brick/money internally
        expect($money->getMinorAmount()->toInt())->toBe(1000)
            ->and($money->getCurrency()->getCurrencyCode())->toBe('USD');
    });

    it('formats the money correctly', function () {
        $money = Money::ofMinor(1234, 'EUR');
        expect($money->formatTo('en_US'))->toBe('‚Ç¨12.34'); // Using locale formatting
    });

    it('throws an exception for invalid currency code', function () {
        Money::ofMinor(100, 'INVALID');
    })->throws(\Brick\Money\Exception\UnknownCurrencyException::class); // Exception from library

    it('can add two money objects of the same currency', function () {
        $one = Money::ofMinor(1000, 'USD');
        $two = Money::ofMinor(500, 'USD');
        $sum = $one->plus($two);
        expect($sum->getMinorAmount()->toInt())->toBe(1500);
    });
    ```
*   **Running:** `./vendor/bin/sail pest --group=unit` or `./vendor/bin/sail test --testsuite=Unit`

### Feature Tests (Laravel HTTP Tests)

*   **Location:** `tests/Feature`
*   **Framework:** Laravel's built-in HTTP testing utilities (based on PHPUnit/Pest).
*   **Purpose:** Test application features from an external perspective, usually by simulating HTTP requests and asserting responses, database state, events dispatched, jobs queued, etc.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Boots the full Laravel framework.
    *   Typically interacts with a test database (using `RefreshDatabase` trait, which migrates and wraps each test in a transaction, or `DatabaseMigrations` trait which migrates once per run).
    *   Can mock external services (Mail, Queues, APIs) using Laravel's fakes (`Mail::fake()`, `Queue::fake()`, `Http::fake()`, `Event::fake()`).
    *   Slower than Unit tests but provide higher confidence in component integration.
*   **Example (Pest):**
    ```php
    // tests/Feature/Auth/RegistrationTest.php
    use App\Domain\Users\Models\User; // Assuming User model is here
    use App\Providers\RouteServiceProvider;
    use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;
    use function Pest\Laravel\{get, post};

    uses(RefreshDatabase::class);

    test('registration screen can be rendered', function () {
        get('/register')->assertStatus(200);
    });

    test('new users can register', function () {
        $response = post('/register', [
            'name' => 'Test User',
            'email' => 'test@example.com',
            'password' => 'password123',
            'password_confirmation' => 'password123',
        ]);

        // Assertions
        $this->assertAuthenticated();
        $response->assertRedirect(RouteServiceProvider::HOME); // Or intended URL
        // Use assertDatabaseHas from Laravel framework
        $this->assertDatabaseHas(User::class, [
            'email' => 'test@example.com',
        ]);
    });
    ```
*   **Running:** `./vendor/bin/sail pest --group=feature` or `./vendor/bin/sail test --testsuite=Feature`

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Cypress)

*   **Location:** `tests/Browser` (if using Dusk) or `tests/e2e` / project root (if using Cypress). Let's assume Cypress.
*   **Framework:** [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/)
*   **Purpose:** Simulate real user interactions in a browser, testing complete user flows across the entire stack (frontend JS, backend API, database).
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Runs in a real browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
    *   Interacts with the application like a user (clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating pages).
    *   Slowest type of test.
    *   Can be brittle if UI structure changes frequently (use `data-testid` attributes).
    *   Provides the highest level of confidence that key user journeys work.
*   **Setup:**
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail npm install cypress --save-dev
    # Configure cypress.config.js (baseUrl = APP_URL, e.g., http://localhost)
    ```
*   **Example Spec (`cypress/e2e/checkout.cy.js`):**
    ```javascript
    describe('Checkout Flow', () => {
      beforeEach(() => {
        // Reset database state and seed specific data for the test
        cy.exec('sail artisan migrate:fresh --seed'); // Use sail within exec
        cy.login('customer@example.com', 'password'); // Custom command to log in via UI or API
      });

      it('allows a user to add a product to cart and checkout successfully', () => {
        cy.visit('/');
        cy.contains('Lavender Essential Oil').click(); // Adjust selector
        cy.url().should('include', '/products/lavender-essential-oil');

        cy.contains('button', /Add to Cart/i).click();
        cy.get('[data-testid="cart-count"]').should('contain', '1'); // Use test IDs

        cy.get('[data-testid="cart-link"]').click(); // Use test IDs
        cy.contains('button', /Checkout/i).click();

        cy.url().should('include', '/checkout');
        // Fill address form
        cy.get('#first_name').type('Jane');
        cy.get('#last_name').type('Doe');
        cy.get('#address_line_1').type('123 Main St');
        cy.get('#city').type('Anytown');
        cy.get('#postal_code').type('12345');
        cy.get('#country_code').select('US');
        cy.get('#phone').type('555-1234');
        cy.get('#email').type('jane.doe@example.com'); // Or ensure pre-filled

        // Stub payment gateway interaction if possible/necessary
        // Or interact carefully with test gateway elements
        cy.contains('button', /Complete Order/i).click();

        // Assert redirect to success page
        cy.url({ timeout: 10000 }).should('include', '/checkout/success'); // Increase timeout
        cy.contains('h1', /Thank you for your order/i).should('be.visible');
      });
    });
    ```
*   **Running:**
    *   Interactive Mode: `sail npx cypress open` (Opens Cypress Test Runner UI)
    *   Headless Mode (CI): `sail npx cypress run`

### API Contract Tests (Dredd - Optional)

*   **Location:** OpenAPI spec at `docs/openapi.yaml`, hooks at `tests/api/hooks.php` (using Dredd PHP hooks).
*   **Framework:** [Dredd](https://dredd.org/) with [Dredd PHP Hooks](https://github.com/ddelnano/dredd-hooks-php).
*   **Purpose:** Validate that the API implementation adheres strictly to its documented contract (OpenAPI spec). Checks request/response structure, status codes, headers.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Runs actual HTTP requests against a running instance of the API.
    *   Compares responses against the OpenAPI schema definitions.
    *   Requires a running application and potentially seeded database state.
    *   Uses 'hooks' (in PHP) to set up state before tests or clean up afterwards.
*   **Setup:**
    ```bash
    # Install Dredd globally or as dev dependency
    # npm install -g dredd
    sail npm install dredd --save-dev
    # Install PHP Hooks handler
    sail composer require --dev ddelnano/dredd-hooks-php
    ```
*   **Running:**
    ```bash
    # Ensure app is running (sail up -d)
    # Run Dredd against local API, using PHP hooks
    sail npx dredd docs/openapi.yaml http://localhost/api/v1 --language=php --hookfiles=./tests/api/hooks.php
    ```

### Mutation Testing (Infection)

*   **Location:** Configuration in `infection.json5` (or similar).
*   **Framework:** [Infection PHP](https://infection.github.io/)
*   **Purpose:** Evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the existing test suite (Unit/Feature). Infection modifies (mutates) your application code slightly and runs your tests. If tests still pass despite the mutation, it means the mutation 'escaped' and your tests didn't detect the change, indicating a potential gap in testing.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Can be very time-consuming, especially on large codebases.
    *   Provides a Mutation Score Indicator (MSI) - percentage of mutants killed by tests.
    *   Helps identify untested code paths or weak assertions.
*   **Setup:**
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail composer require --dev infection/infection
    # Create infection.json5 config file (specify source dirs, test framework, logs)
    ```
*   **Running:**
    ```bash
    # Ensure Xdebug or PCOV is enabled for coverage data
    ./vendor/bin/sail infection --min-msi=80 # Run and fail if MSI is below 80%
    ```

### Static Analysis (PHPStan, Psalm)

*   **Configuration:** `phpstan.neon`, `psalm.xml` in the project root.
*   **Tools:** [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/), [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/)
*   **Purpose:** Analyze code without running it to find potential bugs, type errors, logical inconsistencies, and violations of best practices based on PHP's type system and custom rulesets.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Fast execution.
    *   Catches errors that tests might miss.
    *   Improves code quality, readability, and maintainability.
    *   Configurable strictness levels (PHPStan levels 0-9, Psalm levels 1-8). Aim for high levels (e.g., PHPStan level 8+, Psalm level 1-3).
*   **Running:**
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail phpstan analyse --memory-limit=2G # Check PHPStan config for paths
    ./vendor/bin/sail psalm --show-info=true # Check Psalm config for paths
    ```

### Code Style (Pint/PHP-CS-Fixer)

*   **Configuration:** `pint.json` (for Pint).
*   **Tool:** [Laravel Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/pint) (recommended, built on PHP-CS-Fixer).
*   **Purpose:** Automatically enforce a consistent code style (PSR-12 based, indentation, spacing, syntax) across the entire codebase.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Ensures code uniformity, improving readability.
    *   Reduces cognitive load during code reviews (no need to argue about style).
    *   Can automatically fix most style violations.
*   **Running:**
    ```bash
    # Check for style violations
    ./vendor/bin/sail pint --test

    # Automatically fix style violations
    ./vendor/bin/sail pint
    ```

### Running Tests in CI

*   The CI pipeline (see [CI/CD Section](#-cicd-pipeline-explained-github-actions)) should automate the execution of:
    1.  Code Style Checks (`pint --test`)
    2.  Static Analysis (`phpstan`, `psalm`)
    3.  Unit & Feature Tests (`test` or `pest`) with coverage reporting (optional).
*   E2E tests might run in a separate job, potentially against a deployed staging environment.
*   Mutation tests are often run manually or on a less frequent schedule due to their execution time.

## üö¢ Detailed Deployment Guide: Fly.io & AWS Lightsail

This section provides detailed steps for deploying The Scent platform to two popular hosting options: Fly.io (container-based, simpler) and AWS Lightsail (VPS-based, more manual).

### General Deployment Principles

*   **Environment Parity:** Keep production, staging, and development environments as similar as possible (PHP version, database version, dependencies). Docker/Sail helps significantly with this locally.
*   **Build Artifacts:** Compile frontend assets (`npm run build`) and potentially PHP files (`composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev`) as part of the build/deployment process, not on the production server if possible.
*   **Configuration & Secrets Management:** Use environment variables for all configuration that differs between environments (API keys, database credentials, app URL). NEVER commit secrets to Git. Use platform-specific secret management (Fly Secrets, AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, or `.env` file on Lightsail with strict permissions).
*   **Zero-Downtime Deployments Goal:** Aim for deployment strategies that minimize or eliminate user-facing downtime during updates (e.g., Rolling Deploys, Blue/Green, Atomic Symlink Switching).
*   **Run Laravel Production Commands:** Always run commands like `config:cache`, `route:cache`, `view:cache`, and `php artisan storage:link` after deploying new code.
*   **Run Migrations:** Run database migrations (`php artisan migrate --force`) as part of the deployment process (often as a "release command").

### A) Deploying to Fly.io (Recommended for Simplicity)

Fly.io deploys applications as Docker containers (Firecracker VMs) globally. It simplifies many infrastructure concerns.

**Prerequisites: Fly CLI & Account**

1.  **Create a Fly.io Account:** [Sign up at fly.io](https://fly.io/app/sign-up).
2.  **Install Fly CLI:** Follow instructions at [fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/) (e.g., `brew install flyctl` on macOS).
3.  **Login:** `fly auth login`.

**Initial Launch (`fly launch`)**

This command inspects your project, generates necessary files (`fly.toml`, `Dockerfile` if needed), creates a Fly app, and performs an initial deployment.

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd the-scent

# Run launch - it will ask questions
fly launch

# -- Key Questions --
# ? App Name: (leave blank to generate, or enter e.g., the-scent-prod) -> the-scent-prod
# ? Select organization: (choose your org)
# ? Select region: (choose region close to users, e.g., Amsterdam (ams))
# ? Would you like to setup a Postgresql database now? (No - we'll use MariaDB/MySQL compatible) -> No
# ? Would you like to setup an Upstash Redis database now? (Yes/No - choose based on QUEUE/CACHE driver) -> Yes (if using Redis)
# ? Would you like to deploy now? (Yes/No) -> No (We need to configure secrets and DB first)
```

*   This creates `fly.toml` and potentially a `Dockerfile`. Review and customize these. You might prefer to use your existing `docker/php/Dockerfile` if it's production-ready (ensure it exposes the correct port, e.g., 8080, and uses a production web server like Caddy, Nginx, or Apache + PHP-FPM). Tell `fly launch` to use it: `fly launch --dockerfile ./docker/php/Dockerfile`.

**Database Provisioning**

Fly doesn't have managed MariaDB. Use a managed MySQL-compatible service like PlanetScale, TiDB Cloud, Aiven, or AWS RDS. *Running MariaDB directly on Fly (as shown in proposal B) is possible but less recommended for production due to lack of managed backups, scaling, etc.*

1.  **Provision Managed Database:** Create a MySQL 8+ or MariaDB 10.6+ database instance on your chosen provider (e.g., PlanetScale Free Tier, Aiven).
2.  **Get Credentials:** Obtain the database hostname, port, username, password, and database name.
3.  **Allow Connections:** Ensure the database firewall allows connections from Fly.io's public IP ranges or use Private Networking (VPC Peering) if supported by both Fly and your DB provider.

**Setting Secrets (`fly secrets set`)**

Set environment variables securely for your main application (`the-scent-prod`). Fly encrypts these.

```bash
# Set secrets for your main app (replace the-scent-prod if you used a different name)
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod APP_ENV=production
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod APP_DEBUG=false
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod APP_URL=https://<your-app-name>.fly.dev # Or your custom domain later
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod APP_KEY=$(php -r "echo 'base64:'.base64_encode(random_bytes(32));") # Generate production key locally and copy

# Database Credentials (Replace with your actual managed DB credentials)
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod DB_CONNECTION=mysql # Use mysql driver
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod DB_HOST=<your-managed-db-host>
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod DB_PORT=<your-managed-db-port> # Usually 3306
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod DB_DATABASE=<your-db-name>
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod DB_USERNAME=<your-db-user>
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod DB_PASSWORD='<your-db-password>' # Use single quotes if password has special chars

# Other secrets (Use PRODUCTION keys)
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod STRIPE_KEY=pk_live_...
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod STRIPE_SECRET=sk_live_...
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod MAIL_MAILER=mailgun # Or ses, postmark, etc.
# ... set MAILGUN_DOMAIN, MAILGUN_SECRET, etc. ...
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="hello@your-domain.com" # Use your verified domain
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod MAIL_FROM_NAME="The Scent"

# If using Fly Redis (from launch step):
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod SESSION_DRIVER=redis
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod CACHE_DRIVER=redis
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
# fly redis status -a <redis-app-name> # Find the private URL
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod REDIS_URL=redis://default:<your-redis-password>@<your-redis-name>.flycast:6379

# List secrets to verify
fly secrets list -a the-scent-prod
```

**The `fly.toml` Configuration File**

Review and adjust `fly.toml`. Key sections:

*   `app`: Your app name.
*   `primary_region`: Where the app is primarily deployed.
*   `[build]`: Specifies builder (Nixpacks, Dockerfile) and build arguments (e.g., `PHP_VERSION=8.3`, `NODE_VERSION=20`).
*   `[env]`: Non-secret environment variables (e.g., `LOG_LEVEL=info`).
*   `[http_service]` / `[[services]]`: Defines how traffic reaches your app (ports, health checks, concurrency). Ensure `internal_port` matches the port your app listens on (usually 8080 for standard Laravel Dockerfiles using FPM).
    ```toml
    # fly.toml
    app = "the-scent-prod"
    primary_region = "ams" # Example region

    [build]
      # builder = "paketobuildpacks/builder:base" # If using buildpacks
      dockerfile = "Dockerfile" # If using Dockerfile
      # [build.args] # Pass build args if needed
      #   PHP_VERSION = "8.3"

    [env]
      LOG_CHANNEL = "stderr" # Send logs to Fly's collector
      LOG_LEVEL = "info"
      SESSION_DOMAIN = ".your-domain.com" # Set for production domain
      SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE = "true"

    [http_service]
      internal_port = 8080 # Port PHP-FPM/webserver listens on inside container
      force_https = true
      auto_stop_machines = true # Stop machines when idle (cost saving)
      auto_start_machines = true # Start machines on demand
      min_machines_running = 0 # Or 1 for always-on
      processes = ["app"] # Matches the process group below

    [[vm]] # Define machine size
      cpu_kind = "shared"
      cpus = 1
      memory_mb = 512 # Adjust as needed

    [deploy]
      release_command = "php /var/www/html/artisan migrate --force" # Command to run BEFORE new version is live (adjust path if needed)
      strategy = "rolling" # Or bluegreen

    # Define processes run by Fly Machines
    [processes]
      # 'app' process runs the web server
      app = "php-fpm" # This depends entirely on your Dockerfile's CMD or ENTRYPOINT
      # Example if using Supervisord in the container:
      # app = "/usr/bin/supervisord -c /etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisord.conf"

      # Optional: Define a process for queue workers
      # worker = "php /var/www/html/artisan queue:work redis --sleep=3 --tries=3"
    ```
    *   **CRITICAL:** Ensure the `internal_port` matches the port exposed *inside* your Docker container (often 80 or 8080). Also, ensure the `app` process command correctly starts your web server (PHP-FPM, Caddy, Nginx, etc.) as defined in your `Dockerfile`.

**Deploying (`fly deploy`)**

```bash
fly deploy -a the-scent-prod --remote-only # Use Fly's remote builders
# Or `fly deploy -a the-scent-prod --local-only` if you prefer building locally
```
*   This builds the Docker image, pushes it, runs the `release_command` (migrations), and deploys the new version.

**Running Migrations & Release Commands**

The `release_command` in `fly.toml` handles tasks like migrations *before* the new deployment goes live. Ensure it includes `--force` for migrations as it runs non-interactively. Use the correct path to `artisan` inside the container (`/var/www/html/artisan` is common).

**Scaling Services**

*   **Web Servers (Horizontal Scaling):**
    ```bash
    fly scale count 3 -a the-scent-prod # Scale 'app' process to 3 machines
    # If you defined a 'worker' process in fly.toml:
    # fly scale count worker=2 -a the-scent-prod
    ```
*   **Vertical Scaling (Machine Size):** Adjust `[[vm]]` section in `fly.toml` and redeploy.

**Custom Domains & TLS**

1.  **Add Domain:** `fly domains add your-domain.com -a the-scent-prod`
2.  **Configure DNS:** Follow the instructions provided by the command to add A/AAAA/CNAME records at your DNS provider.
3.  **Issue Certificate:** `fly certs create your-domain.com -a the-scent-prod` (Fly handles Let's Encrypt automatically).

**Logging & Monitoring**

*   **Logs:** `fly logs -a the-scent-prod` (Real-time logs)
*   **Status:** `fly status -a the-scent-prod` (Deployment status, instance count, IPs)
*   **Monitoring:** `fly dashboard -a the-scent-prod` (Opens web dashboard with metrics) or integrate with third-party services.

**Accessing the Production Container (`fly ssh console`)**

```bash
fly ssh console -a the-scent-prod # Connects to a running instance
# Once inside:
php artisan tinker
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log # Note: logs might go to stderr depending on config
# etc.
```

### B) Deploying to AWS Lightsail (LAMP Blueprint - More Manual)

Lightsail provides pre-configured VPS instances. The LAMP stack blueprint includes Linux, Apache, MySQL (we'll likely ignore this and install MariaDB or use RDS), and PHP. This requires more manual server administration.

**(Steps are largely the same as in Proposal B - see above for detailed commands)**

**Key Considerations/Differences for Lightsail:**

1.  **Choose LAMP Blueprint:** Select the latest PHP 8.x version available.
2.  **Database:**
    *   **Option 1 (Use Included MySQL/Install MariaDB):** Follow steps in Proposal B to stop Bitnami's MySQL, install MariaDB server (`sudo apt install mariadb-server`), secure it (`sudo mysql_secure_installation`), and create the database/user. Configure `.env` with `DB_HOST=127.0.0.1`.
    *   **Option 2 (Use AWS RDS):** Provision a managed MySQL or MariaDB instance via AWS RDS. Get the endpoint URL and credentials. Configure the Lightsail instance firewall/security group to allow outbound connections to RDS and configure the RDS security group to allow inbound connections from the Lightsail instance's private IP. Set `DB_HOST` in `.env` to the RDS endpoint. (More robust but adds cost).
3.  **Dependencies:** Ensure `git`, `composer`, `node`, `npm` are installed/updated as needed.
4.  **Project Location:** Place code in `/opt/bitnami/projects/the-scent` or `/var/www/the-scent`. Adjust paths in Apache config, Supervisor config, and cron jobs accordingly.
5.  **Web Server:** Bitnami LAMP uses Apache. Configure the VirtualHost (`/opt/bitnami/apache/conf/vhosts/the-scent-vhost.conf`) pointing the `DocumentRoot` to your project's `/public` directory and ensure `AllowOverride All`. Restart Apache (`sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh restart apache`).
6.  **.env File:** Create `.env` from `.env.example`, fill in **production** credentials (DB, Stripe, Mailgun, APP_KEY, set `APP_ENV=production`, `APP_DEBUG=false`, `APP_URL=https://your-domain.com`). Set strict permissions: `sudo chmod 640 .env` and `sudo chown bitnami:daemon .env`.
7.  **Laravel Production Commands:** Run `optimize:clear`, `config:cache`, `route:cache`, `view:cache`, `storage:link`, `migrate --force`.
8.  **File Permissions:** Ensure `storage/` and `bootstrap/cache/` directories are writable by the web server user (`daemon` in Bitnami stacks). `sudo chown -R bitnami:daemon .` and `sudo find storage bootstrap/cache -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;`, `sudo find storage bootstrap/cache -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;`.
9.  **Cron Job:** Set up the cron job for `php artisan schedule:run` using the correct PHP path (`/opt/bitnami/php/bin/php`).
10. **HTTPS:** Use `sudo /opt/bitnami/bncert-tool` after pointing your domain to the Lightsail Static IP.
11. **Queue Workers:** Install Supervisor (`sudo apt install supervisor`) and configure it (`/etc/supervisor/conf.d/the-scent-worker.conf`) to run `php artisan queue:work` using the correct paths and user (`bitnami`). Reload Supervisor (`sudo supervisorctl reread`, `sudo supervisorctl update`, `sudo supervisorctl start ...`).
12. **Deployment Automation:** Manual SSH deployment is tedious and error-prone. Use tools like [Deployer](https://deployer.org/) (PHP-based deployment tool), [Envoyer](https://envoyer.io/) (Laravel-specific SaaS), or custom shell scripts to automate the process (cloning to release dir, composer/npm install, linking .env/storage, running migrations/cache commands, switching symlink).

### Zero-Downtime Deployment Strategies

*   **Laravel Maintenance Mode:** Useful for short, planned maintenance or during critical migration steps. See Proposal B for commands.
*   **Atomic Deploys (Symlink Switching - Lightsail):** Recommended for VPS. See Proposal B description and look into tools like Deployer for implementation.
*   **Rolling Deploys (Fly.io Default):** Fly.io handles this automatically.

### Post-Deployment Checklist & Troubleshooting

*   **Verify Core Functionality:** Test key user flows (registration, login, browsing, add to cart, checkout).
*   **Check Logs:** Monitor application logs (`storage/logs/laravel.log`), web server logs (Apache/Nginx), and system logs for any errors. On Fly: `fly logs`.
*   **Check Queue Workers:** Ensure queue workers are running (Supervisor status on Lightsail, `fly status` or logs for worker process on Fly) and processing jobs.
*   **Monitor Performance:** Observe CPU/Memory usage, response times.
*   **HTTPS Certificate:** Verify the HTTPS certificate is valid and renewal is working.
*   **Scheduled Tasks:** Confirm cron jobs are running as expected.

### Workflow Triggers (`on:`)

*   Defines when the workflow runs (e.g., on `push` to specific branches, on `pull_request`, manually via `workflow_dispatch`).

### Jobs, Runners, and Services

*   **Jobs:** Independent sets of steps (e.g., `lint`, `test`, `deploy`). Can run in parallel or sequentially (`needs:`).
*   **Runners:** The virtual machines where jobs execute (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`).
*   **Services:** Additional containers linked to the job runner (e.g., `mariadb`, `redis`) needed for testing. Ports are mapped, and health checks ensure they are ready before tests run.

### Checkout & Setup Steps

*   `actions/checkout@v4`: Checks out the repository code onto the runner.
*   `shivammathur/setup-php@v2`: Sets up the specified PHP version, extensions, tools (Composer, Pint), and code coverage drivers (Xdebug/PCOV).
*   `actions/setup-node@v4`: Sets up Node.js.

### Dependency Caching (`actions/cache`)

*   Explicitly caches Composer dependencies using `actions/cache@v4` based on the `composer.lock` hash. Speeds up `composer install`.
*   Node dependencies are cached via `setup-node`'s `cache: 'npm'` option.

### Running Linters & Static Analysis

*   Dedicated steps execute `pint --test` and `phpstan analyse`. The job fails if any of these report errors.

### Executing Tests (Unit, Feature)

*   Runs `vendor/bin/pest` (or `test`).
*   Uses the `services` block to provide a clean database and Redis instance for each test run.
*   Environment variables (`DB_HOST`, `REDIS_HOST`, credentials) are set to connect to these services within the runner's network (`127.0.0.1`) using the dynamic port mapping (`${{ job.services.<service_name>.ports['<port_number>'] }}`).
*   Uses a separate testing database (`the_scent_testing`) configured via env vars.
*   Runs migrations and seeders against the test database.
*   Generates code coverage report (`coverage.xml`) if configured.

### Building Frontend Assets

*   Runs `npm ci` and `npm run build` to ensure frontend assets can be compiled successfully.

### Building Docker Image (Optional, for Fly.io)

*   Not included in this example as it uses `--remote-only` deployment. If building in CI, add steps using `docker/build-push-action@v5`.

### Uploading/Downloading Artifacts

*   Not used in this example, but `actions/upload-artifact@v4` and `actions/download-artifact@v4` can pass files between jobs if needed (e.g., coverage reports, build assets).

### Conditional Deployment Job

*   The `deploy` job uses `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'` to ensure it only runs on direct pushes to the `main` branch.
*   Uses `needs: test` to ensure deployment only happens if tests pass.
*   Uses `environment:` to link to GitHub Environments, which can hold environment-specific secrets (`FLY_API_TOKEN`) and have protection rules.

### Using Secrets in CI/CD

*   Sensitive information (API keys, deploy tokens) are stored as encrypted Secrets in the GitHub repository settings (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions) or within GitHub Environments.
*   Secrets are accessed in the workflow using the `secrets` context (e.g., `${{ secrets.FLY_API_TOKEN }}`). They are masked in logs.

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization & Scalability Considerations

Building for performance and future growth is crucial for an e-commerce platform.

*   **PHP OpCache & JIT Tuning:**
    *   **OpCache:** Enabled by default. Ensure it's configured optimally in production `php.ini` (adequate memory, `validate_timestamps=0` recommended with cache clearing on deploy).
    *   **JIT:** Experiment with JIT (`opcache.jit=tracing` or `function`) in `php.ini`, especially if using Octane. Benchmark carefully as benefits vary.
*   **Leveraging Laravel Octane (RoadRunner/Swoole):**
    *   Consider using Octane to keep the app booted in memory, drastically reducing request latency. Requires careful state management. Integrate with Supervisor or systemd for process management.
*   **HTTP Caching Strategies (ETag, Cache-Control):**
    *   Use `Cache-Control` headers for static assets (via web server/CDN) and appropriate API responses.
    *   Implement ETags (e.g., via middleware like `spatie/laravel-responsecache` or custom logic) for conditional requests (`304 Not Modified`).
*   **Content Delivery Network (CDN) Integration:**
    *   Serve static assets (CSS, JS, images) from a CDN (Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront, BunnyCDN). Configure `ASSET_URL` in `.env`.
*   **Database Optimization (Indexing, Query Analysis):**
    *   **Indexing:** Crucial. Index all foreign keys and columns frequently used in WHERE/ORDER BY clauses. Use `EXPLAIN` to analyze queries.
    *   **Query Analysis:** Prevent N+1 problems with Eager Loading (`Model::with('relation')`). Use Laravel Telescope/Debugbar locally. Select only needed columns. Cache expensive queries (`Cache::remember`).
*   **Read/Write Splitting & Database Replication:**
    *   For high scale, configure database replication and use Laravel's read/write connection splitting (`config/database.php`).
*   **Background Job Processing & Queues:**
    *   Offload non-critical, time-consuming tasks (emails, image processing, reports, webhooks) to Laravel Queues (Redis recommended). Use Horizon for monitoring. Scale workers independently.
*   **Horizontal Scaling (Stateless Application):**
    *   Ensure the application is stateless. Store sessions and cache in shared stores (Redis/Database). Allows adding more web server instances easily.
*   **Load Balancing:**
    *   Handled by platforms like Fly.io or via specific services (AWS ELB, Lightsail Load Balancer) in front of multiple instances.
*   **Application & Server Monitoring (Observability):**
    *   Implement comprehensive Logging (to `stderr` for containers, use services like Papertrail/Datadog), Metrics (Prometheus/Grafana, Datadog APM), and potentially Tracing (OpenTelemetry).

## üîí Security Best Practices Implemented

Security is paramount for an e-commerce platform handling user data and payments. We follow security best practices, guided by OWASP Top 10.

### Mitigating OWASP Top 10 Risks

*(Mapping Laravel features and project practices to OWASP Top 10 2021)*

*   **A01: Broken Access Control:** Use Laravel Gates & Policies, route middleware (`auth`, role checks). Verify resource ownership in policies. Principle of least privilege.
*   **A02: Cryptographic Failures:** `bcrypt` for passwords. `APP_KEY` for encryption (`Crypt` facade). Enforce HTTPS sitewide. Secure TLS config. Use secure payment integrations (Stripe Elements/Intents).
*   **A03: Injection:** Eloquent/Query Builder for SQLi prevention. Blade `{{ }}` escaping for XSS. Validate/sanitize all input (Form Requests). Avoid `eval()`, be careful with shell commands, validate file uploads.
*   **A04: Insecure Design:** Integrate security early (Threat Modeling). Use layered security, proven patterns, proper access control. Limit data exposure. Robust logging/monitoring. Keep dependencies updated.
*   **A05: Security Misconfiguration:** Harden server/container config. Keep software updated. Use environment variables (`.env` secure, not in Git). `APP_DEBUG=false` in prod. Configure Security Headers. Use framework secure defaults. Review configs.
*   **A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components:** Regularly run `composer update`, `npm update`. Use `composer audit`, GitHub Dependabot/Snyk. Remove unused dependencies.
*   **A07: Identification and Authentication Failures:** Use Laravel Fortify/Breeze/Jetstream. Strong password policies. Rate limit login/password reset. Secure session management. Implement MFA (optional). Protect API keys/webhook secrets. Invalidate sessions on logout/password change.
*   **A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures:** Verify webhook signatures. Use Signed URLs. Protect against CSRF (Laravel default). Validate data sources. Secure CI/CD pipeline.
*   **A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures:** Robust logging (Monolog). Log security events (logins, failures, errors). Centralize logs. Set up alerts. Protect logs. Review logs.
*   **A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Validate/sanitize external URLs before making server-side requests (Laravel HTTP Client). Use allow-lists. Avoid reflecting user input in server request URLs.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention

*   **Blade Escaping:** Use `{{ }}` by default. Avoid `{!! !!}` unless input is trusted/sanitized.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP header.
*   **Input Validation:** Rigorous validation and sanitization of all user input.

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection

*   **Laravel Middleware:** `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware enabled by default for `web` routes.
*   **Implementation:** Use `@csrf` in Blade forms. Ensure AJAX requests include `X-CSRF-TOKEN` header (usually handled by `resources/js/bootstrap.js`).

### Rate Limiting Implementation

*   Use Laravel's `throttle` middleware on login routes, password reset routes, and API endpoints. Configured in `app/Providers/RouteServiceProvider.php` or directly on routes.

### Security Headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)

Configure via web server or middleware: `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`. Use tools like `spatie/laravel-csp` to manage CSP.

### Dependency Scanning (Composer Audit, Dependabot)

*   Run `composer audit` regularly and in CI.
*   Enable GitHub Dependabot in repository settings for automated vulnerability checks and update PRs.

### Secrets Management

*   Use `.env` locally (add to `.gitignore`).
*   Use platform-native secret management for production (Fly Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.). Avoid committing secrets.

## üåê Accessibility (a11y), Internationalization (i18n) & SEO

Creating an inclusive and discoverable platform.

### Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Compliance

*   **Target:** Aim for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.
*   **Implementation:** Focus on Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust principles (text alternatives, contrast, keyboard nav, semantic HTML, ARIA, etc.).

### Semantic HTML & ARIA Roles

*   Use native HTML elements correctly. Supplement with ARIA roles/attributes for custom components or dynamic states when necessary.

### Keyboard Navigation & Focus Management

*   Ensure logical tab order. Provide clear visual focus indicators (`focus:` variants). Manage focus within modals/off-canvas elements. Include skip links.

### Internationalization Strategy (Laravel Localization)

*   Use Laravel's Localization: language files in `lang/{locale}`, `__()` helper / `@lang` directive, locale detection (URL, session, browser), middleware for setting locale, pluralization support. Consider RTL CSS if needed.

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Techniques

*   Semantic HTML, unique Titles/Meta Descriptions (`artesaos/seotools`), Open Graph/Twitter Cards, Schema.org JSON-LD, clean URLs, internal linking, image alt text/optimization, XML sitemap (`spatie/laravel-sitemap`), `robots.txt`, fast performance (Core Web Vitals).

### Performance Metrics (Core Web Vitals)

Monitor and optimize LCP (< 2.5s), FID/INP (< 100ms / good), CLS (< 0.1).

### Testing Tools (axe-core, Lighthouse)

Use Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools), axe DevTools browser extension, and potentially automated checks in E2E tests (`cypress-axe`). Perform manual keyboard and screen reader testing.

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap & Future Enhancements

This outlines potential future directions beyond the initial v1.0 launch.

### v1.1 - Post-Launch Iterations

*   **Product Reviews & Ratings:** Allow registered users to submit reviews and star ratings for products. Includes moderation capabilities in the admin dashboard.
*   **Customer Wishlists:** Enable users to save products to a personal wishlist for later purchase.
*   **Basic Gift Cards:** Implement functionality to sell and redeem simple digital gift cards with fixed amounts.

### v1.2 - Feature Expansion

*   **Subscription Boxes:** Introduce recurring subscription options for curated product boxes or specific items. Requires integration with Stripe Billing or similar recurring payment logic.
*   **Enhanced Search:** Integrate with a dedicated search service like Algolia or Meilisearch for faster, more relevant product search with faceting and typo tolerance.
*   **AI-Powered Scent Quiz:** Develop an interactive quiz that recommends products based on user preferences (mood, desired effects, scent profiles).

### v2.0 - Architectural Evolution

*   **Microservices Exploration:** Potentially extract specific domains (e.g., Search, Recommendations, Inventory) into separate microservices for independent scaling and deployment, communicating via APIs or an event bus (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
*   **Event Sourcing:** Consider adopting Event Sourcing for core domains like Orders or Inventory for a complete audit log and temporal querying capabilities.
*   **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Add a service worker, manifest file, and offline capabilities to enhance the mobile experience and allow installation to the homescreen.
*   **Headless Architecture:** Refine the API to fully support a decoupled frontend (e.g., built with Nuxt.js, Next.js) or native mobile applications.

### Contributing to the Roadmap

Ideas and suggestions are welcome! Please open an issue on GitHub with the label `enhancement` or `feature-request` to discuss potential additions to the roadmap. See [Contribution Guidelines](#-contribution-guidelines-how-to-participate).

## ü§ù Contribution Guidelines: How to Participate

We welcome contributions from the community! Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth process.

### Getting Started

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own fork of the `your-org/the-scent` repository on GitHub. *(Replace `your-org`)*
2.  **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:<YourUsername>/the-scent.git
    cd the-scent
    ```
3.  **Set Upstream Remote:** Add the original repository as the `upstream` remote to keep your fork synced.
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/your-org/the-scent.git # Replace your-org
    git fetch upstream
    ```
4.  **Local Development Setup:** Follow the [Comprehensive Local Development Setup Guide](#-comprehensive-local-development-setup-guide).

### Branching Strategy (Gitflow Variant)

*   `main`: Stable production release. Merges only from `develop` (for release) or `hotfix/*`.
*   `develop`: Main integration branch for the next release. Features/fixes merge here.
*   `feature/<feature-name>`: Branch off `develop` for new features. Merge back to `develop` via PR.
*   `fix/<issue-or-desc>`: Branch off `develop` for non-critical bug fixes. Merge back to `develop` via PR.
*   `hotfix/<issue-or-desc>`: Branch off `main` for critical production bugs. Merge back to `main` AND `develop` via PR.
*   *(Optional)* `release/<version>`: Branch off `develop` for release preparation. Merge to `main` & `develop`.

**Workflow:**

1.  `git checkout develop`
2.  `git pull upstream develop` (Sync with upstream)
3.  `git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature` (Create feature branch)
4.  *Make changes, commit frequently using Conventional Commits format.*
5.  *Run linters (`sail pint`) and tests (`sail test`) locally.*
6.  `git push origin feature/my-awesome-feature` (Push to your fork)
7.  Open a Pull Request (PR) from your `feature/my-awesome-feature` branch to the `upstream/develop` branch.

### Commit Message Format (Conventional Commits)

Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. Format: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`

*   **Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`.
*   **Example:** `feat(checkout): implement address validation service`

### Code Style & Linting

*   Follow PSR-12 based style, enforced by Pint.
*   Run `./vendor/bin/sail pint` before committing/pushing. CI will check using `pint --test`.

### Adding Tests

*   Include relevant Unit or Feature tests for new code or bug fixes.
*   Run `./vendor/bin/sail test` locally. CI pipeline will run all tests.

### Submitting Pull Requests (PRs)

1.  Push changes to your fork's feature branch.
2.  Create a PR against the `upstream/develop` branch.
3.  Use a clear title and detailed description (what, why, related issues, testing done).
4.  Ensure "Allow edits from maintainers" is checked.
5.  Ensure CI checks (linting, tests) pass on your PR.

### Code Review Process

*   Maintainers will review PRs. Respond to feedback constructively. Push changes to the same branch to update the PR. PR will be merged upon approval and passing CI checks.

### Reporting Bugs & Suggesting Features

*   Use the GitHub Issues tracker. Provide detailed information (steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, environment). Use issue templates if available.
